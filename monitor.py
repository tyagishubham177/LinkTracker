This script checks the availability of a product on Amulâ€™s shop page.
Because the page loads its product details dynamically via JavaScript,
we use Playwright to render the page. After the dynamic content loads,
we inspect the full HTML to see if markers such as "Sold Out" or "Notify Me"
are present. If one of those markers is found, we assume the product is unavailable.
